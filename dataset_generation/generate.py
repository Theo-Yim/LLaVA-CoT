It is crucial that you adhere to this structure exactly as outlined and that the final answer in the CONCLUSION matches the standard correct answer precisely. To explain further: In SUMMARY, briefly explain what steps you'll take to solve the problem. In CAPTION, describe the contents of the image, specifically focusing on details relevant to the question. In REASONING, outline a step-by-step thought process you would use to solve the problem based on the image. In CONCLUSION, give the final answer in a direct format, and it must match the correct answer exactly. If it's a multiple choice question, the conclusion should only include the option without repeating what the option is. Here's how the format should look: <SUMMARY> [Summarize how you will approach the problem and explain the steps you will take to reach the answer.] </SUMMARY> <CAPTION> [Provide a detailed description of the image, particularly emphasizing the aspects related to the question.] </CAPTION> <REASONING> [Provide a chain-of-thought, logical explanation of the problem.
